# Acomi Web — Complete Gap Analysis

**Date:** 2026-07-28 (updated after Final Implementation Audit)  
**Mobile source of truth:** `K:\AmicoMobile`  
**Web application:** `K:\AmicoWeb`  
**Shared backend:** `K:\Projects\Acomi\Backend\acomi-backend` (now acomi-backend Maven artifact)  

**Scope:** Living parity tracker. Recalculated after independent Phases 1–12 source audit (not documentation-only).

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Acomi Web has shipped **Phases 1–12**, then closed audit-found mobile-wired gaps (**Add Customers hub**, **bulk beds/rooms** outside Quick Setup). Core operator and tenant workflows wired in React Native are present on web with desktop UX improvements and **unchanged** APIs / DTOs / permissions.

### Overall completion (weighted, mobile-wired surfaces)

| Layer | Estimate | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Core operator modules (Dashboard → Inventory)** | **~95–97%** | Builder / Space Health deferred |
| **Account / onboarding / profile / language** | **~95%** | Phase 9 + 11 + space deactivate |
| **Notifications / global home** | **~95%** | Inbox + global + consumer attention; Space Health deferred |
| **Subscription / day-meal billing** | **~90–92%** | Phase 10 |
| **Accommodation depth** | **~93–95%** | Lifecycle + bulk done; Builder deferred |
| **i18n** | **~85%** | Runtime switch + stub locales; en complete for shipped UI |
| **Overall product parity** | **~96–97%** | See [FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md](./FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md) |

**Recommendation:** Ready for staged production deployment. Remaining items are intentional deferrals, not launch blockers.
